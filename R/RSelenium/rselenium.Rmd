#### Running Selenium Server
If I intend to drive a browser on the machine that RSelenium is running on, I need to have a ***Selenium Server*** running on the machine. The Selenium Server is needed in order to run Remote Selenium WebDriver.

- Selenium RC (Remote Control)

- Download Selenium Standalone Server file. Click  [here](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).

- Open a console in my mashine and navigate to where the selenium Standalone Server jar file is located and run this code:

```{text}
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
```
