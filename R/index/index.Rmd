This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

- [interest rate of return](./internal_rate_of_return.nb.html)
- [interest rate risk](./interest_rate_risk.nb.html)
- [normal distribution](./normal_distribution.nb.html)
- [credit card](./credit_card.nb.html)
- [file system](./file_system.nb.html)

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
